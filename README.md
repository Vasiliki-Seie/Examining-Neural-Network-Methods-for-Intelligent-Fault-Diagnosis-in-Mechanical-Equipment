### Examining Neural Network Methods for Intelligent Fault Diagnosis in Mechanical Equipment 
In this work, weexamined the effectiveness and feasibility of various proposed methods that are verified experimentally using the CWRU datasets for bearing fault detection. The preprocess was made in MATLAB and the main code was written in Python language. #
